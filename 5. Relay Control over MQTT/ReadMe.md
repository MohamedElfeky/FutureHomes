** Relay Control over MQTT.**
 
In this program, your ESP8266 device will subscribe itself to Adafruit's MQTT broker. From Adafruit's dashboard you can create the topic and publish your messages.
Once message is published, it will be conveyed to all the subscriber's located at any location [ Ofcourse Internet Connection is prerequisite].
Based on this received message, relay/relays will be turned on/off.

**Note:** Make sure you have installed the Adafruit's MQTT library and have created the account with Adafruit. Cautiously notedown the **'Private Key'** and **'Username'**.
Also, the names of 'feeds' are **case sensetive.**
