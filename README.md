# FutureHomes
IoT based home automation.

This project is for getting familiar with various home automation protocols and the hardware used for controlling various devices like Light, Camera, AC, Motors etc.

**PROJECT   TYPE:** Custom

**PROJECT   TITLE:** Home automation system using IoT. 

**TOOLS NEEDED:**

1. Arduino IDE
2. ESP8266 NodeMCU
3. Bread Board
4. LEDs and Jumper Cables
5. Relays based on current requirement.
5. Embedded C

**BASIC SCHEDULE:**

1. Team will finalize the requirements
2. Distribution of indivisual task, discussion and integration.
3. Milestone 1:  
    a. Date:  1 December 2017,   
       i. Get familiar with NodeMCU, mqtt protocol.
       ii. Hardware requirements discussion & finalization.
       iii. Finalizing the cloud service for mqtt broker.
4. Milestone 2:
    a. Date:  1 January 2018,   
       i. Integration and First Demo.

**EXPECTED  RESULTS:**

The main crux of the project is to make future homes smarter and energy efficient. The focus is to connect all basic household devices using IoT.
There are myriad number of devices, each having different comminication protocols. Need to identify and find workaround for making all of them work in an uniform way.


## IMP FUNCTIONS.

**void setup()**

The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. Use it to initialize variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc. The setup() function will only run once, after each powerup or reset of the Arduino board.

**void loop()**

After creating a setup() function, which initializes and sets the initial values, the loop() function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond. Use it to actively control the Arduino board.
